                          Building the boardgame
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just run the buid script (build.bat for windows users).
$ build

If you are doing this the first time, you will see an error saying that it 
can't find a few dependencies.  All jars that can't be found from normal maven
repos should be found in the top-level lib directory.

Once built, the final product is a zip file that contains all the packged 
libraries as well as a jre containing the proper Java3D native libraries.

Final zip file located at <project-home>/target/final.

                           Running the boardgame
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Extract the zip file mentioned about and run the boardgame startup script 
either by double clicking or by executing from the command line.

Enjoy!
