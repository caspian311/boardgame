System Requirements

1. Java 3D available at:
https://java3d.dev.java.net/binary-builds.html
(this project was built using 1.5.2, other versions may or may not work)

Building the boardgame
------------------------------------------------------------------------

$ mvn package

If you are doing this the first time, you will see an error saying that 
it can't find a dependency.  All jars that can't be found from normal 
maven repos should be found in the lib directory.

The final built jar is located here:
<project-home>/target/boardgame.jar


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running the boardgame
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Go to the location of the jar file mentioned above and run the following
command:

$java -jar boardgame.jar


Enjoy!
